and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## Unreleased

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
- `axi_modify_address`: Fix unconnected `w_valid`.

## 0.18.0 - 2020-03-24

### Added
- `axi_dw_converter`: a data width converter between AXI interfaces of any data width.  Depending on
  its parametrization, this module instantiates one of the following:
  - `axi_dw_downsizer`: a data width converter between a wide AXI master and a narrower slave.
  - `axi_dw_upsizer`: a data width converter between a narrow AXI master and a wider slave.


## 0.17.0 - 2020-03-23

### Added
- Add `axi_isolate` to isolate downstream slaves from receiving new transactions.

### Changed
- `axi_lite_to_axi`: Add mandatory `AxiDataWidth` parameter to enable fix mentioned below.

### Fixed
- Improve compatibility with Xcelium:
  - by removing unsupported hierarchical argument to `$bits()` function in `axi_lite_to_axi`;
  - by removing unsupported `struct` assignment in `axi_lite_demux`.


## 0.16.3 - 2020-03-19

### Changed
- `axi_err_slv`: Add optional parameter to define data returned by read response.  The parameter
  defaults to a 64-bit value, so buses with data width larger than or equal to 64 bit see an
  additional 32-bit value in error responses compared to the prior version.  Other than that, this
  change is fully backward compatible.


## 0.16.2 - 2020-03-16

### Fixed
- `axi_atop_filter`: Fix underflow in counter for `AxiMaxWriteTxns = 1`.


## 0.16.1 - 2020-03-13

### Fixed
- Remove whitespace in and semicolon after macro calls.
- `axi_intf`: Improve Verilator compatibility by disabling unsupported assertions.


## 0.16.0 - 2020-03-11

### Added
- `axi_cdc_intf`: Add interface variant of AXI clock domain crossing.

### Fixed
- `axi_cdc`: Remove unused global `import axi_pkg::*`.
- `axi_intf`: Remove global `import axi_pkg::*` and explicitly use symbols from `axi_pkg`.
- `axi_lite_cut_intf`: Add missing assigns to and from interface ports.
- `tb_axi_cdc`:
  - Remove global `import axi_pkg::*`.
  - Define channels with `AXI_TYPEDEF` macros instead of local `typedef`s.

### Removed
- Remove unused `AXI_ARBITRATION` and `AXI_ROUTING_RULES` interfaces.


## 0.15.1 - 2020-03-09

### Added
- `axi_intf`: Add single-channel assertions to `AXI_BUS_DV`.

### Fixed
- `axi_lite_to_apb`: Fix the interface version (`axi_lite_to_apb_intf`) to match the changes from
  version `0.15.0`.
- `axi_demux`: When `MaxTrans` was 1, the `IdCounterWidth` became 0.  This has been fixed.
- `axi_atop_filter`:
  - The master interface of this module in one case depended on `aw_ready` before applying
    `w_valid`, which is a violation of the AXI specification that can lead to deadlocks.  This issue
    has been fixed by removing that dependency.
  - The slave interface of this module could illegally change the value of B and R beats between
    valid and handshake.  This has been fixed.
- `rand_axi_master` (in `axi_test`):
  - Fix infinite wait in `send_ws` task.
  - Decouple generation of AWs from sending them.  This allows to apply W beats before or
    simultaneous with AW beats.
- `rand_axi_slave` (in `axi_test`):
  - Decouple receiving of Ws from receiving of AWs.  This allows to receive W beats independent of
    AW beats.
- Update `common_cells` to `1.16.4` to fix synthesis warning in `id_queue`.


## 0.15.0 - 2020-02-28

### Added
- `axi_burst_splitter`: Split AXI4 bursts to single-beat transactions.

### Changed
- `axi_lite_to_apb`: The `psel` field of the `apb_req_t` struct is now a single bit.  That is, every
  APB slave has its own request struct.  Accordingly, `apb_req_o` is now an array with `NoApbSlaves`
  entries.
- `axi_decerr_slv` has been replaced by a more generic `axi_err_slv`, which takes the kind of error
  as parameter.  This `axi_err_slv` no longer has a `FallThrough` parameter; instead, a response
  (i.e., B or R beat) now always comes one cycle after the AW or AR beat (as required by the AXI
  Spec) but the slave can accept a W beat in the same cycle as the corresponding AW beat.
  Additionally, `axi_err_slv` got a parameter `ATOPs` that defines if it supports atomic operations.
- `axi_to_axi_lite`: Rework module to structs and add burst support.

### Fixed
- `axi_demux`: The `case` statement controlling the counters had not been specified `unique` even
  though it qualified for it.  This has been fixed.
- `axi_lite_mux_intf`: Fix signal names in internal assignments, names of parameters of
  `axi_lite_mux` instance, and typos in assertion messages.


## 0.14.0 - 2020-02-24

### Added
- Add `axi_lite_mailbox`: AXI4-Lite mailbox.


## 0.13.0 - 2020-02-18

### Added
- `axi_xbar_intf`: Add interface variant of crossbar.

### Fixed
- `axi_atop_filter`: Fix ModelSim warnings by adding `default` statement.  The signal in the `case`
  has a single bit, and both values were correctly handled in synthesis.  However, when starting
  simulation, the signal has an undefined value, and ModelSim threw warnings that this violated the
  `unique` condition.
- `axi_demux`: Move `typedef` outside `generate` for compatibility with VCS.
- `axi_id_prepend`:
  - Fix text of some assertion messages.
  - Fix case of prepending a single-bit ID.
- `tb_axi_xbar`: Fix for localparam `AxiIdWidthSlaves` to be dependent on the number of masters.


## 0.12.0 - 2020-02-14

### Added
- `axi_lite_to_apb`: AXI4-Lite to APB4 converter.


## 0.11.0 - 2020-02-13

### Added
- `axi_cdc`: Add a safe AXI clock domain crossing (CDC) implementation.

### Changed
- The interface variants of `axi_demux` and `axi_mux` have been changed to match the convention for
  interface variants in this repository:
  - `axi_demux_wrap`: Change name to `axi_demux_intf` and change parameter names to ALL_CAPS.
  - `axi_mux_wrap`: Change name to `axi_mux_intf`, and change parameter names to ALL_CAPS.
- `axi_demux`: Default parameters to `0`.

### Fixed
- `axi_demux`: Add parameter case for `NoMstPorts == 1`.


## 0.10.2 - 2020-02-13

### Fixed
- `axi_atop_filter`: Remove unreachable `default` in `unique case` block.
- `axi_demux_wrap`: Fix signals passed to demux.
- `axi_lite_demux_intf`: Fix signal passed to demux.
- `axi_lite_mux`: Add missing declaration of `r_fifo_push`.


## 0.10.1 - 2020-02-12

### Fixed
- `axi_lite_xbar`: Fix synthesis for `NoMstPorts == 1`.


## 0.10.0 - 2020-02-11

### Added
- `axi_lite_xbar`: fully-connected AXI4-Lite crossbar.
- `axi_lite_demux`: AXI4-Lite demultiplexer from one slave port to a configurable number of master
  ports.
- `axi_lite_mux`: AXI4-Lite multiplexer from a configurable number of slave ports to one master
  port.

### Changed
- `axi_test`: Extended package with random AXI4-Lite master and slave test bench classes.


## 0.9.2 - 2020-02-11

### Fixed
- `axi_pkg`: Fix value of `CUT_ALL_PORTS` (in `xbar_latency_e`) in Vivado synthesis.


## 0.9.1 - 2020-01-18

### Fixed
- `axi_decerr_slv`: Fix parameter to be UpperCamelCase


## 0.9.0 - 2020-01-16

### Added
- `axi_test`: Constrained randomizing AXI master (`rand_axi_master`) and slave (`rand_axi_slave`).
  - `rand_axi_master` issues a configurable number of read and write transactions to configurable
    memory regions (address ranges with associated memory types) and with random properties within
    constraints (e.g., burst length, exclusive accesses, atomic operations).
  - `rand_axi_slave` responds to transactions with random delays and data.
- `axi_pkg`: AXI memory types (`mem_type_t`) and functions `get_arcache` and `get_awcache` to
  calculate `AxCACHE` bits for a given memory type.
- Add `axi_decerr_slv`.
- Add `axi_id_prepend`.
- Add fully compliant `axi_xbar`.
- Add documentation on `axi_mux`, `axi_demux` and `axi_xbar`
- Module overview to `README.md`

### Changed
- `axi_test`: The `reset` tasks in `axi_driver` and `axi_lite_driver` are now functions.
- Bump `common_cells` to `1.16.0` which contains the address decoding logic used in `axi_xbar`.

### Fixed
- `axi_intf` move import into interface bodies.
- `axi_pkg` make functions automatic, fixing a problem with Synopsys.


## 0.8.2 - 2019-12-20

### Fixed
- `src_files.yml`: Add `only_local` flag for `axi_test`.
- `axi_test`:
  - Add missing default parameters to `axi_lite_driver`.
  - Move wildcard import from `axi_test` into package to prevent pollution of compilation unit.


## 0.8.1 - 2019-12-19

### Added
- `axi_pkg`: Functions to calculate addresses and byte positions within a beat.


## 0.8.0 - 2019-12-19

All modules have been changed from SystemVerilog interfaces to struct ports.  Thus, all modules in
this repository are now available in tools that do not support interfaces.  Interfaces are now
opt-in: every module has a variant with `_intf` suffix that is functionally equivalent but has
interfaces instead of struct ports.  If you would like to keep using interfaces, please add an
`_intf` suffix to any module you are using from this repository.  Some `_intf` variants require more
parameters (e.g., to define the ID width) than the module prior to this release, but otherwise the
`_intf` variants are drop-in replacements.

We encourage the use of structs to build AXI infrastructure, and we have added a set of `typdef`
macros and have extended the `assign` macros to keep designers productive and prevent mismatches.

Additionally, we have removed a set of modules that had known issues.  We will provide new
implementations for these modules in near-term releases and no longer support the removed modules.

The individual changes for each module follow.

### Added
- `assign.svh`:
  - Macros for setting an AXI or AXI-Lite interface from channel or request/response structs inside
    a process (`AXI_SET_FROM_*` and `AXI_LITE_SET_FROM_*`) and outside a process like an assignment
    (`AXI_ASSIGN_FROM_*` and `AXI_LITE_ASSIGN_FROM_*`).
  - Macros for setting channel or request/response structs to the signals of an AXI or AXI-Lite
    interface inside a process (`AXI_SET_TO_*` and `AXI_LITE_SET_TO_*`) and outside a process like
    an assignment (`AXI_ASSIGN_TO_*`, `AXI_LITE_ASSIGN_TO_*`).
- `typedef.svh`: Macros for defining AXI or AXI-Lite channel (`AXI_TYPEDEF_*_CHAN_T` and
  `AXI_LITE_TYPEDEF_*_CHAN_T`) and request/response structs (`AXI_TYPEDEF_RE{Q,SP}_T` and
  `AXI_LITE_TYPEDEF_RE{Q,SP}_T`).

### Changed
- `axi_atop_filter` has been changed from interfaces to struct ports.  Please use the newly added
  `axi_atop_filter_intf` module if you prefer interfaces.
- `axi_cut` has been changed from interfaces to struct ports.  Please use the newly added
  `axi_cut_intf` module if you prefer interfaces.
- `axi_delayer` has been changed from interfaces to struct ports.  Please use the newly added
  `axi_delayer_intf` module if you prefer interfaces.
- `axi_join` has been renamed to `axi_join_intf`, and `axi_lite_join` has been renamed to
  `axi_lite_join_intf`.  To join two structs, simply assign them instead.
- `axi_multicut` has been changed from interfaces to struct ports.  Please use the newly added
  `axi_multicut_intf` module if you prefer interfaces.
- `axi_modify_address` has been changed from interfaces to struct ports.  Please use the newly added
  `axi_modify_address_intf` module if you prefer interfaces.
- `axi_lite_to_axi` has been changed from interfaces to struct ports.  Please use the newly added
  `axi_lite_to_axi_intf` module if you prefer interfaces.

### Removed
- `axi_lite_xbar`:  This interconnect module was not a full crossbar and its routing rules interface
  no longer fits our demands.  A replacement will be provided in a near-term release.
- `axi_address_resolver` was used together with `axi_lite_xbar` and is removed along with it.  If a
  standalone replacement for this module is required, please use `addr_decoder` from `common_cells`.
- `axi_arbiter` was used together with `axi_lite_xbar` and is removed along with it.  If a
  standalone replacement of this module is required, please use `rr_arb_tree` from `common_cells`.
  A near-term release will introduce an AXI multiplexer and demultiplexer to suit protocol-specific
  needs.
- `axi_id_remap` had problems with ordering and ATOPs.  A new, correct implementation will be
  provided in a near-term release.
- `axi_lite_cut` has been rendered unnecessary by changing `axi_cut` to struct ports.  To get a cut
  with AXI-Lite ports, simply pass AXI-Lite channels and request/response structs as parameters.  If
  you prefer interfaces, please replace any `axi_lite_cut` with the newly added `axi_lite_cut_intf`
  module.
- `axi_lite_multicut`: same rationale and transition procedure as for `axi_lite_cut`.
- In `axi_pkg`, the `*Width` `localparam`s and the `id_t`, `addr_t`, etc. `typedef`s have been
  removed.  There is no one-fits-all value of these parameters, so we cannot provide a generic
  definition for them in this package.  Please use the added macros in `typedef.svh` to define your
  own types with a few lines of code (which you can put into your own package, for example).


## 0.7.2 - 2019-12-03

### Fixed
- axi_to_axi_lite: Fix underflow in internal buffers.
- axi_to_axi_lite: Remove restriction on size of internal buffers.

## 0.7.1 - 2019-11-19

### Changed
- axi_multicut: Simplified implementation without changing I/O behavior.

### Fixed
- src_files: Removed `axi_test.sv` from synthesized files.
- tb_axi_lite_xbar: Fixed AW->W dependency.

## 0.7.0 - 2019-05-28

### Changed
- The `in` and `out` modports have been removed from the interface definition of both AXI and AXI
  Lite.  These modports were "aliases" of `Slave` and `Master`, respectively, and caused problems
  because many tools did not recognize the aliases as being identical to `Slave` and `Master`.

## 0.6.0 - 2019-02-27

### Changed
- AXI interfaces now include the `aw_atop` signal. Interfaces, macros, and existing modules and
  TBs in this repository have been updated. The ReadMe has been updated to guide users of this
  repository on how to deal with the `aw_atop` signal.

### Added
- Add AXI atomic operations (ATOPs) filter.

### Fixed
- Replace non-ASCII characters in Solderpad license text.
- Add a trailing semicolon to the `AXI_ASSIGN()` and `AXI_LITE_ASSIGN()` macros in `assign.svh`
  (#8). Those macros can now be used without a semicolon. Existing code that uses the macros with a
  semicolon do not break.

## 0.5.0 - 2018-12-18
- Add axi channel delayer

### Changed
- Remove clock from `AXI_BUS` and `AXI_LITE`.  Such a clock signal is useful for testing purposes
  but confusing (or even harmful) in hardware designs.  For testing purposes, the `AXI_BUS_DV` and
  `AXI_LITE_DV` (suffix for "design verification") interfaces have been defined instead.

### Fixed
- Update `src_files.yml` to match `Bender.yml`.
- Add missing `axi_test` to compile script.
