This repository provides modules to build on-chip communication networks adhering to the [AXI4 or AXI4-Lite standards][AMBA 5 Spec].  For high-performance communication, we implement AXI4[+ATOPs from AXI5](#atomic-operations).  For lightweight communication, we implement AXI4-Lite.  We aim to provide a complete end-to-end communication platform, including endpoints such as DMA engines and on-chip memory controllers.

Our **design goals** are:
- **Topology Independence**: We provide elementary building blocks such as protocol [multiplexers](src/axi_mux.sv) and [demultiplexers](src/axi_demux.sv) that allow users to implement any network topology.  We also provide commonly used interconnecting components such as a [crossbar](src/axi_xbar.sv).
- **Modularity**: We favor design by composition over design by configuration where possible.  We strive to apply the *Unix philosophy* to hardware: make each module do one thing well.  This means you will more often instantiate our modules back-to-back than change a parameter value to build more specialized networks.
- **Fit for Heterogeneous Networks**: Our modules are parametrizable in terms of data width and transaction concurrency.  This allows to create optimized networks for a wide range of performance (e.g., bandwidth, concurrency, timing), power, and area requirements.  We provide modules such as [data width converters](src/axi_dw_converter.sv) and [ID width converters](src/axi_iw_converter.sv) that allow to join subnetworks with different properties, creating heterogeneous on-chip networks.
- **Full AXI Standard Compliance**.
- **Compatibility** with a [wide range of (recent versions of) EDA tools](#which-eda-tools-are-supported) and implementation in standardized synthesizable SystemVerilog.

The **design and microarchitecture** of the modules in this repository is described in [**this paper**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9522037) ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05334)).  If you use our work in your research, please cite it.

## Atomic Operations

AXI4+ATOPs means the full AXI4 specification plus atomic operations (ATOPs) as defined in Section E1.1 of the [AMBA 5 specification][AMBA 5 Spec]. This has the following implications for modules that do not implement ATOPs and systems that include such modules:

- Masters that do not issue ATOPs must set `aw_atop` to `'0`.
- Slaves that do not support ATOPs must specify this in their interface documentation and can ignore the `aw_atop` signal.
- System designers are responsible for ensuring that
  1. slaves that do not support ATOPs are behind an [`axi_atop_filter`](src/axi_atop_filter.sv) if any master could issue an ATOP to such slaves and
  2. the `aw_atop` signal is well-defined at the input of any (non-AXI4-Lite) module in this repository.

Masters and slaves that do support ATOPs must adhere to Section E1.1 of the [AMBA 5 specification][AMBA 5 Spec].  In particular:
- ATOPs that have the `aw_atop[axi_pkg::ATOP_R_RESP]` bit set generate a write response (B channel) beat and at least one read response (R channel) beat.  All modules for which the `aw_atop[axi_pkg::ATOP_R_RESP]` bit could be set at their master port must be able to handle both B and R beats (in any order and without requiring a simultaneous handshake) for each such ATOP request.  All modules for which the `aw_atop[axi_pkg::ATOP_R_RESP]` bit could be set at their slave port must respond with the appropriate number of B and R beats for each such ATOP request.
- ATOPs must not use the same AXI ID as any other transaction that is outstanding at the same time.


## Which EDA Tools Are Supported?

Our code is written in standard SystemVerilog ([IEEE 1800-2012][], to be precise), so the more important question is: Which subset of SystemVerilog does your EDA tool support?

We aim to be compatible with a wide range of EDA tools.  For this reason, we strive to use as simple language constructs as possible, especially for our synthesizable modules.  We encourage contributions that further simplify our code to make it compatible with even more EDA tools.  We also welcome contributions that work around problems that specific EDA tools may have with our code, as long as:
- the EDA tool is reasonably widely used,
- recent versions of the EDA tool are affected,
- the workaround does not break functionality in other tools, and
- the workaround does not significantly complicate code or add maintenance overhead.

In addition, we suggest to report issues with the SystemVerilog language support directly to the EDA vendor. Our code is fully open and
can / should be shared with the EDA vendor as a testcase for any language problem encountered.

All code in each release and on the default branch is tested on a recent version of at least one industry-standard RTL simulator and synthesizer.  You can examine the [CI settings](./.gitlab-ci.yml) to find out which version of which tool we are running.
